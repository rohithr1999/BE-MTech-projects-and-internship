### Project Title:
#### Experimental Characterization of Mortar Using Bagasse Ash and Fly Ash Hybridization

### Project Description:
This project investigates the potential of utilizing industrial and agricultural waste materials—fly ash (a by-product from coal combustion) and bagasse ash (a by-product of sugarcane industry)—as partial replacements for cement in mortar. The main objective is to enhance the sustainability of construction materials by reducing cement consumption, lowering CO₂ emissions, and effectively managing waste.

A series of mortar mix designs were prepared with varying proportions of fly ash and bagasse ash as cement replacements. These hybrid mixes were experimentally evaluated to understand their effects on:

Compressive strength

Workability

Setting time

Durability characteristics

Standard tests as per IS specifications were conducted on mortar cubes to compare performance against conventional cement mortar. The study aims to identify the optimal hybrid proportion that balances strength, sustainability, and cost-effectiveness.

#### Key Outcomes:
Hybrid mixes containing both bagasse ash and fly ash showed promising results in terms of strength and environmental benefits.

The use of these waste materials contributed to a significant reduction in cement content without compromising essential mechanical properties.

The research highlights a feasible approach toward eco-friendly mortar development for sustainable construction practices.
