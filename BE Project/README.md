## Project Title: 
#### Morphometric and Hypsometric Analysis of Manachabale Reservoir
The present study focuses on the morphometric and hypsometric analysis of the Manachabale Reservoir catchment using geospatial techniques and remote sensing data. These analyses are critical for understanding the terrain characteristics, watershed behavior, erosion status, and sedimentation patterns, which are essential for effective water resource management.

### Morphometric Analysis
Morphometric analysis involves the quantitative evaluation of the catchmentâ€™s geometric and topographic parameters. For the Manachabale Reservoir, key linear, areal, and relief aspects were analyzed, including:

Stream order, stream length, and bifurcation ratio, which indicate the drainage pattern and development stage of the basin.

Drainage density, stream frequency, and texture ratio, reflecting the permeability and compactness of the terrain.

Form factor, elongation ratio, and circularity ratio, which help assess the flood potential and shape of the watershed.

The morphometric results indicate that the catchment is moderately dissected with a dendritic drainage pattern, suggesting homogeneous lithology and structural control over drainage development. The low bifurcation ratio and moderate drainage density suggest less structural disturbance and medium runoff potential.

### Hypsometric Analysis
Hypsometric analysis was carried out to understand the erosional development stage and volume distribution of the basin. The hypsometric curve and hypsometric integral (HI) were derived from the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the study area.

The hypsometric integral value obtained for the Manachabale catchment places it in the mature stage of geomorphic evolution, indicating a balanced state between erosion and deposition. The concave shape of the hypsometric curve further suggests that most of the erosional activity has already occurred, with less sediment yield expected in the near future.
