## Project Title: 
#### Morphometric and Hypsometric Analysis of Manachabale Reservoir
The present study focuses on the morphometric and hypsometric analysis of the Manachabale Reservoir catchment using geospatial techniques and remote sensing data. These analyses are critical for understanding the terrain characteristics, watershed behavior, erosion status, and sedimentation patterns, which are essential for effective water resource management.

### Morphometric Analysis
Morphometric analysis involves the quantitative evaluation of the catchment’s geometric and topographic parameters. For the Manachabale Reservoir, key linear, areal, and relief aspects were analyzed, including:

Stream order, stream length, and bifurcation ratio, which indicate the drainage pattern and development stage of the basin.

Drainage density, stream frequency, and texture ratio, reflecting the permeability and compactness of the terrain.

Form factor, elongation ratio, and circularity ratio, which help assess the flood potential and shape of the watershed.

The morphometric results indicate that the catchment is moderately dissected with a dendritic drainage pattern, suggesting homogeneous lithology and structural control over drainage development. The low bifurcation ratio and moderate drainage density suggest less structural disturbance and medium runoff potential.

### Hypsometric Analysis
Hypsometric analysis was carried out to understand the erosional development stage and volume distribution of the basin. The hypsometric curve and hypsometric integral (HI) were derived from the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the study area.

The hypsometric integral value obtained for the Manachabale catchment places it in the mature stage of geomorphic evolution, indicating a balanced state between erosion and deposition. The concave shape of the hypsometric curve further suggests that most of the erosional activity has already occurred, with less sediment yield expected in the near future.

### Project Title:
#### Experimental Characterization of Mortar Using Bagasse Ash and Fly Ash Hybridization

### Project Description:
This project investigates the potential of utilizing industrial and agricultural waste materials—fly ash (a by-product from coal combustion) and bagasse ash (a by-product of sugarcane industry)—as partial replacements for cement in mortar. The main objective is to enhance the sustainability of construction materials by reducing cement consumption, lowering CO₂ emissions, and effectively managing waste.

A series of mortar mix designs were prepared with varying proportions of fly ash and bagasse ash as cement replacements. These hybrid mixes were experimentally evaluated to understand their effects on:

Compressive strength

Workability

Setting time

Durability characteristics

Standard tests as per IS specifications were conducted on mortar cubes to compare performance against conventional cement mortar. The study aims to identify the optimal hybrid proportion that balances strength, sustainability, and cost-effectiveness.

#### Key Outcomes:
Hybrid mixes containing both bagasse ash and fly ash showed promising results in terms of strength and environmental benefits.

The use of these waste materials contributed to a significant reduction in cement content without compromising essential mechanical properties.

The research highlights a feasible approach toward eco-friendly mortar development for sustainable construction practices.
